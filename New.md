predecting quality and maintence , the predctive analysis of AI is really amazing .decisions vs predictive it provides predicting about decisions we can make . 
Co-poilot mode - where in AI provides inputs and we decide about the decision .


large amount data AI can analyse and give feedback . yeild and loss production addressed . energy used to make a product .
lot of customers dont realise unless it is implement it.

ex : construction building customers. Proven in method in AI , assembled  group of SME's  outside of companises parterned data scientis and data engineers in digital transformation .
refernce to other companies and use cases they can apply to their company , what is the high impact?, loss of revenue?easiest adapt to impement? feed study ? divie in to data , clean it up no noise .
run it through ML alogorithirms and you see predectiablity of 80 % and more .that proves out the sucessful.multi step process and  AI and IOT  should go hand in hand. IOT should be in right place .



Problem : people lossing their jobs , like white collar jobs . how is it going to impact ? we have not seen it as a replacement . Most of the decision support mechanism is what AI help you to make faster and quicker decision with huge/large data
Still you need engineer and supervisor to operate .

Ex : Autonompus cars , in case of any issue in driving car it would beep or take a decision to apply brake .


Future of manufactrurer should look at technology to be sucessful
